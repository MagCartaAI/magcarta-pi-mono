# Development Rules

## First Message
If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message,
read README.md, then ask which module(s) to work on. Based on the answer, read the relevant README.md files in parallel.
- packages/ai/README.md
- packages/tui/README.md
- packages/agent/README.md
- packages/coding-agent/README.md
- packages/mom/README.md
- packages/pods/README.md
- packages/web-ui/README.md

## Code Quality
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- **NEVER use inline imports** - no `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears to be intentional
- Never hardcode key checks with, eg. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`. All keybindings must be configurable. Add default to matching object (`DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS`)

## Commands
- After code changes (not documentation changes): `npm run check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- Note: `npm run check` does not run tests.
- NEVER run: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `npx tsx ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`
- Run tests from the package root, not the repo root.
- When writing tests, run them, identify issues in either the test or implementation, and iterate until fixed.
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## GitHub Issues
When reading issues:
- Always read all comments on the issue
- Use this command to get everything in one call:
  ```bash
  gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,state
  ```

When creating issues:
- Add `pkg:*` labels to indicate which package(s) the issue affects
  - Available labels: `pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:mom`, `pkg:pods`, `pkg:tui`, `pkg:web-ui`
- If an issue spans multiple packages, add all relevant labels

When posting issue/PR comments:
- Write the full comment to a temp file and use `gh issue comment --body-file` or `gh pr comment --body-file`
- Never pass multi-line markdown directly via `--body` in shell commands
- Preview the exact comment text before posting
- Post exactly one final comment unless the user explicitly asks for multiple comments
- If a comment is malformed, delete it immediately, then post one corrected comment
- Keep comments concise, technical, and in the user's tone

When closing issues via commit:
- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message
- This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged

## PR Workflow
- Analyze PRs without pulling locally first
- If the user approves: create a feature branch, pull PR, rebase on main, apply adjustments, commit, merge into main, push, close PR, and leave a comment in the user's tone
- You never open PRs yourself. We work in feature branches until everything is according to the user's requirements, then merge into main, and push.

## Tools
- GitHub CLI for issues/PRs
- Add package labels to issues/PRs: pkg:agent, pkg:ai, pkg:coding-agent, pkg:mom, pkg:pods, pkg:tui, pkg:web-ui

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

To test pi's TUI in a controlled terminal environment:

```bash
# Create tmux session with specific dimensions
tmux new-session -d -s pi-test -x 80 -y 24

# Start pi from source
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "cd /Users/badlogic/workspaces/pi-mono && ./pi-test.sh" Enter

# Wait for startup, then capture output
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t pi-test -p

# Send input
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "your prompt here" Enter

# Send special keys
tmux send-keys -t pi-test Escape
tmux send-keys -t pi-test C-o  # ctrl+o

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t pi-test
```

## Style
- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Changelog
Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (each package has its own)

### Format
Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:
- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules
- Before adding entries, read the full `[Unreleased]` section to see which subsections already exist
- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]` section
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`)
- Each version section is immutable once released

### Attribution
- **Internal changes (from issues)**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/123))`
- **External contributions**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Adding a New LLM Provider (packages/ai)

Adding a new provider requires changes across multiple files:

### 1. Core Types (`packages/ai/src/types.ts`)
- Add API identifier to `Api` type union (e.g., `"bedrock-converse-stream"`)
- Create options interface extending `StreamOptions`
- Add mapping to `ApiOptionsMap`
- Add provider name to `KnownProvider` type union

### 2. Provider Implementation (`packages/ai/src/providers/`)
Create provider file exporting:
- `stream<Provider>()` function returning `AssistantMessageEventStream`
- Message/tool conversion functions
- Response parsing emitting standardized events (`text`, `tool_call`, `thinking`, `usage`, `stop`)

### 3. Stream Integration (`packages/ai/src/stream.ts`)
- Import provider's stream function and options type
- Add credential detection in `getEnvApiKey()`
- Add case in `mapOptionsForApi()` for `SimpleStreamOptions` mapping
- Add provider to `streamFunctions` map

### 4. Model Generation (`packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts`)
- Add logic to fetch/parse models from provider source
- Map to standardized `Model` interface

### 5. Tests (`packages/ai/test/`)
Add provider to: `stream.test.ts`, `tokens.test.ts`, `abort.test.ts`, `empty.test.ts`, `context-overflow.test.ts`, `image-limits.test.ts`, `unicode-surrogate.test.ts`, `tool-call-without-result.test.ts`, `image-tool-result.test.ts`, `total-tokens.test.ts`, `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`.

For `cross-provider-handoff.test.ts`, add at least one provider/model pair. If the provider exposes multiple model families (for example GPT and Claude), add at least one pair per family.

For non-standard auth, create utility (e.g., `bedrock-utils.ts`) with credential detection.

### 6. Coding Agent (`packages/coding-agent/`)
- `src/core/model-resolver.ts`: Add default model ID to `DEFAULT_MODELS`
- `src/cli/args.ts`: Add env var documentation
- `README.md`: Add provider setup instructions

### 7. Documentation
- `packages/ai/README.md`: Add to providers table, document options/auth, add env vars
- `packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md`: Add entry under `## [Unreleased]`

## Releasing

**Lockstep versioning**: All packages always share the same version number. Every release updates all packages together.

**Version semantics** (no major releases):
- `patch`: Bug fixes and new features
- `minor`: API breaking changes

### Steps

1. **Update CHANGELOGs**: Ensure all changes since last release are documented in the `[Unreleased]` section of each affected package's CHANGELOG.md

2. **Run release script**:
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch    # Fixes and additions
   npm run release:minor    # API breaking changes
   ```

The script handles: version bump, CHANGELOG finalization, commit, tag, publish, and adding new `[Unreleased]` sections.

## **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**
- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
- You MUST read every file you modify in full before editing.

## **CRITICAL** Git Rules for Parallel Agents **CRITICAL**

Multiple agents may work on different files in the same worktree simultaneously. You MUST follow these rules:

### Committing
- **ONLY commit files YOU changed in THIS session**
- ALWAYS include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message when there is a related issue or PR
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - these sweep up changes from other agents
- ALWAYS use `git add <specific-file-paths>` listing only files you modified
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging YOUR files
- Track which files you created/modified/deleted during the session

### Forbidden Git Operations
These commands can destroy other agents' work:
- `git reset --hard` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git checkout .` - destroys uncommitted changes
- `git clean -fd` - deletes untracked files
- `git stash` - stashes ALL changes including other agents' work
- `git add -A` / `git add .` - stages other agents' uncommitted work
- `git commit --no-verify` - bypasses required checks and is never allowed

### Safe Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check status first
git status

# 2. Add ONLY your specific files
git add packages/ai/src/providers/transform-messages.ts
git add packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "fix(ai): description"

# 4. Push (pull --rebase if needed, but NEVER reset/checkout)
git pull --rebase && git push
```

### If Rebase Conflicts Occur
- Resolve conflicts in YOUR files only
- If conflict is in a file you didn't modify, abort and ask the user
- NEVER force push

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **magcarta-pi-mono** (8045 symbols, 23834 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/magcarta-pi-mono/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/magcarta-pi-mono/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/magcarta-pi-mono/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/magcarta-pi-mono/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/magcarta-pi-mono/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
